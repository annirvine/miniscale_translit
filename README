Transliteration training and decoding with sample Urdu data

1. If using a mac, update SRILM call in train_helper (comment out line 72, uncomment line 73)
If using CLSP or COE clusters, do nothing.

2. Set JOSHUA, SRILM, and JAVA_HOME environment variables appropriately (or use my pointers at the top of train_helper and test_helper for coe machines)

3. To train a system, create directory with a file containing a "train" file and a "dev" file with transliteration pairs, then run (pointing to training directory):
./train_main.sh demo_data/urdu
Example directory is demo_data/urdu (note that these example train and dev files already have beginning of word and end of word symbols appended)

4. To decode a test set, run:
./translit_strings.sh demo_data/urdu/urdu_test demo_data/urdu
First arg: test file (list of single words to decode)
Second arg: pointer to same directory given in training step, above

Output in demo_data/urdu/urdu_test.answer
For this example, references are given in demo_data/urdu/urdu_test.ref for comparison

Using your own data

train/dev data:
To use your own, just need to create directory with a train and dev file. Script to append beginning and word and end of word symbols: addSymTrainDev.py (run: python addSymTrainDev.py inputTrain)

language model data:
Two English language model files are included in demo_data/lm 
One is taken from Wikipedia person-page titles and the other from NE-labeled Gigaword corpus, and each includes relative frequency counts.
Can use other LM, just change pointer in train_main.sh (and script for adding beginning of word and end of word symbols in demo_data/lm)

Substitute transliterations into Joshua MT output

After generating transliterations for all OOV words, create a dictionary file (oov word - tab - transliterated word), and substitute them into the Joshua output:
python sub-oovs.py tab-separated-oov-dictionary translation-output-file
